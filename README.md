# Irish GNIB Booking Helper

## Introduction
This is a [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (or [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/)) script for the Irish [INIS Registration Appointment Booking System](https://burghquayregistrationoffice.inis.gov.ie) on the [GNIB Appointment Booking Page](https://burghquayregistrationoffice.inis.gov.ie/Website/AMSREG/AMSRegWeb.nsf/AppSelect?OpenForm).

It gives you the available appointments closest to today at the top of the page, before you filing out the form to look for an appointment.
